# igniteui-angular-api-i18n

## Purpose

This respository stores the Japanese translations for the Ignite UI for Angular API documentation.  It also stores the English files for comparison purposes.

## File Generation

The files are generated by using the [TypeDoc Localization Plugin](https://github.com/IgniteUI/typedoc-plugin-localization/).

## File Usage

The Japanese files here will be used in the Japanese API build.  The English files will not be used in any build.  They are only used to compare changes between versions of the generated files.

## Branches

The branching scheme must follow the [Ignite UI for Angular](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular) branching.  Work in the master branch, and when we are getting ready for a release, create a versioned branch (ex. 6.2.x).  This will allow the build to get the correct version of the files.
